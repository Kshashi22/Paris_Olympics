## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Paris Olympics 2024 Dataset** obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahityasetu/paris-olympics-2024-total-medals-tally).
The objective is to explore medal counts, athlete participation, sports performance, and country-wise achievements during the **Paris 2024 Summer Olympics**.

The entire **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization** process was performed **by me using Google Colab**, ensuring a smooth and interactive workflow for large-scale analytics.

If you want, I can now **create an enhanced README with real medal tallies and top-performing countries extracted from your actual Paris Olympics dataset** so it looks more authentic and attractive on GitHub.
Do you want me to prepare that version?
